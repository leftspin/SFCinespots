Project Requirements:

Build an iOS app using Xcode in Swift to display locations where movies were filmed in San Francisco.

Requirements:
Data should be retrieved from the API using JSON
URL: https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/yitu-d5am/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD
Documentation: https://data.sfgov.org/developers
Data Set: https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am
Data should be displayed as a sorted list showing the movie, date, and location

Bonus Points:
Track your work in git
Donâ€™t use any third party frameworks
Tapping on an item in the list displays that location on a map
Provide a way for the user to apply custom sorting to the list
Cache parsed data locally in Core Data
